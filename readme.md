# React Playground

This is just a playground to get my hands dirty using react. This is not really a project itself, more-so, just a way to mess around and see what I can do. This was taken from the Scrimba course (on YouTube) found [here](https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?si=79X7X_NJGD4zHUD0).

## What's Included in this Project?

- A static website using react.
- React was implemented for this project using the [CDN version](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html), and not the normal method. This was meant to be a quick and dirty type of project.
- Uses Babel to transpile modern JavaScript syntac into code that can run in all environments.
- An attempt was made to try and import the react dependencies and not use the CDN, but that didn't seem to work.

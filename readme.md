# React Project 1 - Static Webpage

This project is to make a static website using react. This was taken from the Scrimba course (on YouTube) found [here](https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?si=79X7X_NJGD4zHUD0).

## What's Included in this Project?

- A static website using react.
- React was implemented for this project using the [CDN version](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html), and not the normal method. This was meant to be a quick and dirty type of project.
